      <h3 className={classes.title}>Our Story...</h3>
      <p className={classes.content}>
        Established in 2010, this app was the brain child of the reclusive but brillant individuals, Spongebob and Patrick. The idea of Eatsy was born out of
        frustration during a rainy Sunday evening. When both individual decided to order take out and both were craving for some south American food. However
        they soon realize that there were no such options available around where they were living.
      </p>
      <p className={classes.content}>
        Undeterred, they searched even further out (300 miles radius to be precise) but to their surprise, there was not a single food delivery place that
        offers a South American option. With frustration, they concluded that this is unacceptable and decided to do something about it. And something about it
        they did! After twelve months of countless sleepless nights, Eatsy was born!
      </p>
      <p className={classes.content}>
        In the mid of 2015, the Eatsy family further expanded with the inclusion of two important members. Firstly, Mr Krabs, an establish legend in the
        industry joined team to support communications and marketing. Rounding up the four member team is Squidward. The team has been leveraging Squidward's
        decades of experience in customer service/support to maintain Eatsy's high customer satisfaction. On a side note, the food app "Eatsi" has no
        affiliation to Eatsy. Eatsi app was founded by our competitor/arch nemesis/mortal enemy "Plankton".
